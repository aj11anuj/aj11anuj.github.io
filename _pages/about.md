         Effective hyperparameter optimization is a common method for improving the performance of machine learning models
         and is a key aspect of enhancing their efficiency and generalization ability. In this work, we investigate the
         hyperparameter optimization of two popular models, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), using three
         nature-inspired optimization algorithms: Bald Eagle Optimization (BEO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and
         Mother Tree Optimization (MTO). We evaluate these algorithms across five different datasets, including both image
         and tabular data, to rigorously assess their performance and the transferability of the findings across diverse
         settings. Our results show that Optuna delivers predictable and stable performance across a variety of evaluation
         metrics, particularly in balancing accuracy and computational efficiency, while the nature-inspired optimizers
         exhibit dataset-specific behavior, performing strongly in certain scenarios but inconsistently overall. The study
         highlights that no single optimizer can be universally recommended; instead, each method offers distinct advantages
         depending on dataset characteristics and model requirements, providing practical insights for real-world
         hyperparameter tuning in machine learning.
